I spent about 8 or 9 hours working on this. It was a fun challenge, I think it turned out good. Everything works, but there is definitely room for improvement on the frontend. It would be cool to add a title screen and more animation and sound effects, better font, etc. The code could definitely be a bit more DRY, but I have already spent a lot of time on it so I will stop here for now.
